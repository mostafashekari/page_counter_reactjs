As you can see in the picture above, in this project, which is written in JavaScript and uses React JS and Node JS, the buttons are designed so that when the step is on the first option (page 1) , disable the "Prev" button. And when the step is on the last option (page 4), disable the "Next" button. Also, when you go to the next page, the color of that page turns on, and when you leave that page, the color of that page turns off. I hope it is useful
